# About

This comes out of necessity. I store my texts as plain text files in my Dropbox. Then I want others
to read it, but it's hard. You can just share the links and they don't render nice. And also,
I wish my friends to have a nice reading experience, as if they read an ebook.

The solution is BeMyBook. Here is the flow:

  * You go to the app page and pick the txt files you want to share as a book from a Dropbox chooser
  * Type a title, hit the button et voil√†! You have to link to share

The idea is the public links of the files go to the app and it stores them. Just the links,
not the text itself. Then when you browse the files they get rendered.

Dropbox asks "These URLs should not be used to display content directly in the browser."
So this app displays them indirectly :|

Hope I'll finish this project!
